							<h3>As an undergraduate researcher under Dr. Sunho Lim, I have been exploring applications and implementations of personal drone technology. Over the past semester, a significant focus of our work involved constructing an abstract model of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using Simulink. The primary objective was to create a robust testbed capable of validating algorithms before uploading them to physical drones. Our next phase of research is to test our algorithms against the simulation model before eventually purchasing a drone for real-world experimentation. This research is supported by the NSF EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER)  program.</h3>
