				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am a senior at Texas Tech University, currently enrolled in the Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Master of Science in Software and Security Engineering program while also pursuing a minor in Mathematics. I plan to graduate with my Bachelor's in December 2024 and my Master's in December 2025. Throughout my time at Texas Tech, I have been able to acquire a variety of skills and knowledge that I can use to further my career in the field of Computer Science. My coursework has allowed me to gain a broad understanding of programming practice and a deep understanding of computer science theory. I am also involved in many extracurricular activities on and off campus, including being an ambassador of the university through President's Select, a member of the Mortar Board, formerly an executive officer of Beta Upsilon Chi, and a weekly volunteer with my local church.</p>

							<p>C</p>
						</div>
						<div class="skill-cell back">
							<p>As a student at Texas Tech I have become very familiar with C. Much of my core course work was based in C with the intent of teaching efficient programming principles. As I have progress into the latter stages of my degree, I have gotten to work with C++ for various projects. Both of these have taught me about writing code with efficiency in mind.</p>

							<p>Python</p>
						</div>
						<div class="skill-cell back">
							<p>I have developed my proficiency with Python through various personal and academic projects. My most in depth use comes from my research with TrUE scholars where we are developing a decsision system to aid in lung cancer treatment using Bayesian Networks in Python. Through this experince I have not only gotten to learn more about python but also finding and using libraries such as Pandas, Networkx, and Matplotlib.</p>

							<p>Matlab</p>
						</div>
						<div class="skill-cell back">
							<p>Matlab is a language that I have gotten to use in courses such as Mathematical Computing where I was able to implement an elliptic curve cryptography scheme. In addition to this I have gotten hands on experince in simulation modeling and data visualization in my Cyber Aerial Computing course.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="skill-cell back">
							<p>My current focus area in my research with the department of computer science is to develop a testbed for drone simulation in Matlab Simulink. This has allowed me to hone my skills in modeling various kinds of systems to test new algorithms on.</p>

						<div class="skill-cell back">
							<p>The stylistic choices on this website were primarily implemented using CSS. From the animations to the fonts, CSS was the engine behind it. Similar to HTML, I was able to gain a lot of valueable experince in CSS through building this site and also through previous projects.</p>
