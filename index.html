				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Currently a senior at Texas Tech University, I am pursuing an Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Master of Science in Software and Security Engineering program, with a minor in Mathematics. Anticipating graduation with my Bachelor's in December 2024 followed by my Master's in December 2025, I have dedicated my academic journey to acquiring a diverse skill set and expansive knowledge base in the realm of Computer Science. My coursework has provided me with understanding of both programming practice and computer science theory. Beyond academics, I actively engage in extracurricular activities on and off campus. As an ambassador of the university through President's Select, a member of Mortar Board, and formerly an executive officer of Beta Upsilon Chi, I have honed leadership skills backed by a spirit of service and excellence. Additionally, my commitment to service is reflected in my weekly volunteer work with my local church. Driven by a passion for innovation, after my time in academia I hope to enter industry and make meaningful contributions to Computer Science and beyond.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="skill-cell back">
							<p>As a student at Texas Tech I have become very familiar with C. Much of my core course work was based in C with the intent of teaching efficient programming principles. As I have progress into the latter stages of my degree, I have gotten to work with C++ for various projects. Both of these have taught me about writing code with efficiency in mind.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="skill-cell back">
							<p>My proficiency in Python has been cultivated through a blend of personal explorations and academic endeavors. The most noteworthy of which is my involvement in undergraduate research with TrUE scholars, where we are crafting a decision system to enhance lung cancer treatment utilizing Bayesian Networks implemented in Python. This experience has deepened my understanding of Python and libraries such as Pandas, Networkx, and Matplotlib. I've not only refined my coding skills but also had the opportunity to see how a software project is managed in a research environment.</p>
